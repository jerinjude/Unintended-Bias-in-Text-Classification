      "4 [1][2][3] As a sexual orientation, homosexuality is \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions\" to people of the same sex.\n",
      "5 It \"also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.\n",
      "6 \"[4][5]Along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum.\n",
      "7 [4] Scientists do not yet know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences[6][7][8] and do not view it as a choice.\n",
      "8 [6][7][9] Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, scientists favor biologically based theories.\n",
      "9 [6] There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males.\n",
      "10 [10][11][12] There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role with regard to sexual orientation.\n",
      "11 [13] While some people believe that homosexual activity is unnatural,[14] scientific research shows that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects.\n",
      "12 [4][15] There is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation.\n",
      "13 [16][17]The most common adjectives for homosexual people are lesbian for females and gay for males, but the term gay also commonly refers to both homosexual females and males.\n",
      "14 The percentage of people who are gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who are in same-sex romantic relationships or have had same-sex sexual experiences are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons, including many gay and lesbian people not openly identifying as such due to prejudice or discrimination such as homophobia and heterosexism.\n",
      "15 [18] Homosexual behavior has also been documented in many non-human animal species,[24] though humans are one of only two species known to exhibit a homosexual orientation.\n",
      "16 [10]Many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships.\n",
      "17 These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects.\n",
      "18 [5] Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred.\n",
      "19 [25] Since the end of the 20th century, there has been a global movement towards freedom and equality for gay people, including the introduction of anti-bullying legislation to protect gay children at school, legislation ensuring non-discrimination, equal ability to serve in the military, equal access to health care, equal ability to adopt and parent, and the establishment of marriage equality.Contents1 Etymology2 History2.1 Africa2.2 Americas2.2.1 Indigenous cultures2.2.2 Canada2.2.3 United States2.3 East Asia2.4 South Asia2.5 Europe2.5.1 Classical period2.5.2 Renaissance2.5.3 Modern period2.6 Middle East2.6.1 Pre-Islamic period2.7 South Pacific3 Sexuality and identity3.1 Behavior and desire3.2 Sexual identity and sexual fluidity3.3 Same-sex relationships3.4 Coming out of the closet4 Demographics5 Psychology6 Causes6.1 Biological vs. environmental determinants6.1.1 \"Gay genes\"6.2 Evolutionary perspectives6.3 Sexual orientation change efforts7 Parenting8 Health8.1 Physical8.1.1 Public health8.2 Mental8.3 Gay and lesbian youth9 Law and politics9.1 Legality9.2 Laws against sexual orientation discrimination9.2.1 United States9.2.2 European Union9.3 Political activism9.4 Military service10 Society and sociology10.1 Public opinion10.2 Relationships10.3 Religion11 Discrimination11.1 Gay bullying11.2 Heterosexism and homophobia11.3 Violence against homosexuals12 Homosexual behavior in other animals13 See also14 Notes15 References15.1 Books15.2 Journal articles15.3 Online articles16 External linksEtymology\"Poof\" redirects here.\n",
      "20 For other uses, see Poof (disambiguation).Main article: Terminology of homosexuality Zephyrus and Hyacinthus Attic red-figure cup from Tarquinia, 480 BC (Boston Museum of Fine Arts)The word homosexual is a Greek and Latin hybrid, with the first element derived from Greek ὁμός homos, \"same\" (not related to the Latin homo, \"man\", as in Homo sapiens), thus connoting sexual acts and affections between members of the same sex, including lesbianism.\n",
      "21 [26][27] The first known appearance of homosexual in print is found in an 1868 letter to Karl Heinrich Ulrichs by the Austrian-born novelist Karl-Maria Kertbeny.\n",
      "22 [28][29] arguing against a Prussian anti-sodomy law.\n",
      "23 [29][30] In 1886, the psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing used the terms homosexual and heterosexual in his book Psychopathia Sexualis.\n",
      "24 Krafft-Ebing's book was so popular among both laymen and doctors that the terms heterosexual and homosexual became the most widely accepted terms for sexual orientation.\n",
      "25 [31][32] As such, the current use of the term has its roots in the broader 19th-century tradition of personality taxonomy.Many modern style guides in the U.S. recommend against using homosexual as a noun, instead using gay man or lesbian.\n",
      "26 [33][citation needed] Similarly, some recommend completely avoiding usage of homosexual as it has a negative, clinical history and because the word only refers to one's sexual behavior (as opposed to romantic feelings) and thus it has a negative connotation.\n",
      "27 [33] Gay and lesbian are the most common alternatives.\n",
      "28 The first letters are frequently combined to create the initialism LGBT (sometimes written as GLBT), in which B and T refer to bisexual and transgender people.Gay especially refers to male homosexuality,[34] but may be used in a broader sense to refer to all LGBT people.\n",
      "29 In the context of sexuality, lesbian refers only to female homosexuality.\n",
      "30 The word lesbian is derived from the name of the Greek island Lesbos, where the poet Sappho wrote largely about her emotional relationships with young women.\n",
      "31 [35][36]Although early writers also used the adjective homosexual to refer to any single-sex context (such as an all-girls school), today the term is used exclusively in reference to sexual attraction, activity, and orientation.\n",
      "32 The term homosocial is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not specifically sexual.\n",
      "33 There is also a word referring to same-sex love, homophilia.Some synonyms for same-sex attraction or sexual activity include men who have sex with men or MSM (used in the medical community when specifically discussing sexual activity) and homoerotic (referring to works of art).\n",
      "34 [37][38] Pejorative terms in English include queer, faggot, fairy, poof, poofter[39] and homo.\n",
      "35 [40][41][42][43] Beginning in the 1990s, some of these have been reclaimed as positive words by gay men and lesbians, as in the usage of queer studies, queer theory, and even the popular American television program Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.\n",
      "36 [44] The word homo occurs in many other languages without the pejorative connotations it has in English.\n",
      "37 [45] As with ethnic slurs and racial slurs, the use of these terms can still be highly offensive.\n",
      "38 The range of acceptable use for these terms depends on the context and speaker.\n",
      "39 [46] Conversely, gay, a word originally embraced by homosexual men and women as a positive, affirmative term (as in gay liberation and gay rights),[47] came into widespread pejorative use among young people in the early 2000s.\n",
      "40 [48]The American LGBT rights organization GLAAD advises the media to avoid using the term homosexual to describe gay people or same-sex relationships as the term is \"frequently used by anti-gay extremists to denigrate gay people, couples and relationships\".\n",
      "41 [49]HistoryMain articles: LGBT history, Timeline of LGBT history, and History of homosexualitySome scholars argue that the term \"homosexuality\" is problematic when applied to ancient cultures since, for example, neither Greeks or Romans possessed any one word covering the same semantic range as the modern concept of \"homosexuality\".\n",

      "207 As results from such research accumulated, professionals in medicine, mental health, and the behavioral and social sciences reached the conclusion that it was inaccurate to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder and that the DSM classification reflected untested assumptions based on once-prevalent social norms and clinical impressions from unrepresentative samples comprising patients seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct brought them into the criminal justice system.In recognition of the scientific evidence,[144] the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973, stating that \"homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.\"\n",
      "208 After thoroughly reviewing the scientific data, the American Psychological Association adopted the same position in 1975, and urged all mental health professionals \"to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientations.\"\n",

      "328 gay culture is exemplified by the gay pride movement, with annual parades and displays of rainbow flags.\n",
      "329 Yet not all LGBT people choose to participate in \"queer culture\", and many gay men and women specifically decline to do so.\n",
      "330 To some[who?]\n",
      "331 it seems to be a frivolous display, perpetuating gay stereotypes.\n",
      "332 Original Rainbow Pride Flag in San Francisco, designed by Gilbert Baker in 1978With the outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s, many LGBT groups and individuals organized campaigns to promote efforts in AIDS education, prevention, research, patient support, and community outreach, as well as to demand government support for these programs.The death toll wrought by the AIDS epidemic at first seemed to slow the progress of the gay rights movement, but in time it galvanized some parts of the LGBT community into community service and political action, and challenged the heterosexual community to respond compassionately.\n",
      "333 Major American motion pictures from this period that dramatized the response of individuals and communities to the AIDS crisis include An Early Frost (1985), Longtime Companion (1990), And the Band Played On (1993), Philadelphia (1993), and Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt (1989).Publicly gay politicians have attained numerous government posts, even in countries that had sodomy laws in their recent past.\n",
      "334 Examples include Guido Westerwelle, Germany's Vice-Chancellor; Pete Buttigieg, the United States Secretary of Transportation, Peter Mandelson, a British Labour Party cabinet minister and Per-Kristian Foss, formerly Norwegian Minister of Finance.LGBT movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations.\n",
      "335 Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermine the traditional family[216] and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother.\n",
      "336 [217][218] Some argue that gay rights may conflict with individuals' freedom of speech,[219][220] religious freedoms in the workplace,[221][222] the ability to run churches,[223] charitable organizations[224][225] and other religious organizations[226] in accordance with one's religious views, and that the acceptance of homosexual relationships by religious organizations might be forced through threatening to remove the tax-exempt status of churches whose views do not align with those of the government.\n",
      "337 [227][228][229][230] Some critics charge that political correctness has led to the association of sex between males and HIV being downplayed.\n",
      "338 [231]Military service U.S. President Barack Obama signs into law the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010Main article: Sexual orientation and military servicePolicies and attitudes toward gay and lesbian military personnel vary widely around the world.\n",
      "339 Some countries allow gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people to serve openly and have granted them the same rights and privileges as their heterosexual counterparts.\n",
      "340 Many countries neither ban nor support LGB service members.\n",
      "341 A few countries continue to ban homosexual personnel outright.Most Western military forces have removed policies excluding sexual minority members.\n",
      "342 Of the 26 countries that participate militarily in NATO, more than 20 permit openly gay, lesbian and bisexual people to serve.\n",
      "343 Of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, three (United Kingdom, France and United States) do so.\n",
      "344 The other two generally do not: China bans gay and lesbian people outright, Russia excludes all gay and lesbian people during peacetime but allows some gay men to serve in wartime (see below).\n",
      "345 Israel is the only country in the Middle East region that allows openly LGB people to serve in the military.While the question of homosexuality in the military has been highly politicized in the United States, it is not necessarily so in many countries.\n",
      "346 Generally speaking, sexuality in these cultures is considered a more personal aspect of one's identity than it is in the United States.\n",
      "347 [citation needed]According to the American Psychological Association, empirical evidence fails to show that sexual orientation is germane to any aspect of military effectiveness including unit cohesion, morale, recruitment and retention.\n",
      "348 [232] Sexual orientation is irrelevant to task cohesion, the only type of cohesion that critically predicts the team's military readiness and success.\n",

      "351 Western society has become increasingly accepting of homosexuality since the 1990s.\n",
      "352 In 2017, Professor Amy Adamczyk contended that these cross-national differences in acceptance can be largely explained by three factors: the relative strength of democratic institutions, the level of economic development, and the religious context of the places where people live.\n",
      "353 [236]RelationshipsIn 2006, the American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and National Association of Social Workers stated in an amicus brief presented to the Supreme Court of California: \"Gay men and lesbians form stable, committed relationships that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects.\n",
      "354 The institution of marriage offers social, psychological, and health benefits that are denied to same-sex couples.\n",
      "355 By denying same-sex couples the right to marry, the state reinforces and perpetuates the stigma historically associated with homosexuality.\n",
      "356 Homosexuality remains stigmatized, and this stigma has negative consequences.\n",
      "357 California's prohibition on marriage for same-sex couples reflects and reinforces this stigma\".\n",
      "358 They concluded: \"There is no scientific basis for distinguishing between same-sex couples and heterosexual couples with respect to the legal rights, obligations, benefits, and burdens conferred by civil marriage.\n",
      "359 \"[5]ReligionMain article: Religion and homosexualityThough the relationship between homosexuality and religion is complex, current authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions view homosexual behaviour negatively.\n",
      "360 [citation needed] This can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, to explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality.\n",
      "361 Some teach that homosexual desire itself is sinful,[237] others state that only the sexual act is a sin,[238] while others are completely accepting of gays and lesbians.\n",
      "362 [239] Some claim that homosexuality can be overcome through religious faith and practice.\n",
      "363 On the other hand, voices exist within many of these religions that view homosexuality more positively, and liberal religious denominations may bless same-sex marriages.\n",
      "364 Some view same-sex love and sexuality as sacred, and a mythology of same-sex love can be found around the world.\n",
      "365 [240]Discrimination LGBT activists at Cologne Pride in 2015 carrying a banner with the flags of 70 countries where homosexuality is illegalGay bullyingMain article: Gay bullyingGay bullying can be the verbal or physical abuse against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or generally queer, including persons who are actually heterosexual or of non-specific or unknown sexual orientation.\n",
      "366 In the US, teenage students heard anti-gay slurs such as \"homo\", \"faggot\" and \"sissy\" about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes, according to a 1998 study by Mental Health America (formerly National Mental Health Association).\n",

      "368 A 2011 Dutch study concluded that 49% of Holland's youth and 58% of youth foreign to the country reject homosexuality.\n",
      "369 [242] Similar to other minority groups they can also be subject to stereotyping.\n",
      "370 These attitudes tend to be due to forms of homophobia and heterosexism (negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships).\n",
      "371 Heterosexism can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the norm and therefore superior.\n",
      "372 Homophobia is a fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexual people.\n",
      "373 It manifests in different forms, and a number of different types have been postulated, among which are internalized homophobia, social homophobia, emotional homophobia, rationalized homophobia, and others.\n",
      "374 [243] Similar is lesbophobia (specifically targeting lesbians) and biphobia (against bisexual people).\n",
      "375 When such attitudes manifest as crimes they are often called hate crimes and gay bashing.Negative stereotypes characterize LGB people as less romantically stable and more likely to abuse children, but there is no scientific basis to such assertions.\n",
      "376 Gay men and lesbians form stable, committed relationships that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects.\n",
      "377 [5] Sexual orientation does not affect the likelihood that people will abuse children.\n",
      "378 [244][245][246] Claims that there is scientific evidence to support an association between being gay and being a pedophile are based on misuses of those terms and misrepresentation of the actual evidence.\n",

      "380 56.7% of these crimes were based on bias against homosexual men.\n",
      "381 11.1% were based on bias against homosexual women.\n",
      "382 29.6% were based on anti-homosexual bias without regard to gender.\n",

      "384 In certain parts of the world, LGBT people are also at risk of \"honor killings\" perpetrated by their families or relatives.\n",
      "385 [248][249][250]In Morocco, a constitutional monarchy following Islamic laws, homosexual acts are a punishable offence.\n",
      "386 With a population hostile towards LGBT people, the country has witnessed public demonstrations against homosexuals, public denunciations of presumed homosexual individuals, as well as violent intrusions in private homes.\n",
      "387 The community in the country is exposed to additional risk of prejudice, social rejection and violence, with a greater impossibility of obtaining protection even from the police.\n",

      "389 [252]Homosexual and bisexual behaviors occur in a number of other animal species.\n",
      "390 Such behaviors include sexual activity, courtship, affection, pair bonding, and parenting,[22] and are widespread; a 1999 review by researcher Bruce Bagemihl shows that homosexual behavior has been documented in about 500 species, ranging from primates to gut worms.\n",
      "391 [22][23] Animal sexual behavior takes many different forms, even within the same species.\n",
      "392 The motivations for and implications of these behaviors have yet to be fully understood, since most species have yet to be fully studied.\n",
      "393 [253] According to Bagemihl, \"the animal kingdom [does] it with much greater sexual diversity—including homosexual, bisexual and nonreproductive sex—than the scientific community and society at large have previously been willing to accept\".\n",
      "394 [254] According to Bailey et al., humans and domestic sheep are the only animals conclusively proven to exhibit a homosexual orientation.\n",
      "395 [10]A review paper by N. W. Bailey and Marlene Zuk looking into studies of same-sex sexual behaviour in animals challenges the view that such behaviour lowers reproductive success, citing several hypotheses about how same-sex sexual behavior might be adaptive; these hypotheses vary greatly among different species.\n",
      "396 Bailey and Zuk also suggest future research needs to look into evolutionary consequences of same-sex sexual behaviour, rather than only looking into origins of such behaviour.\n",

      "961 One widely reported early estimate was 10% (e.g., Marmor, 1980; Voeller, 1990).\n",
      "962 Some recent data provided support for this estimate (Bagley and Tremblay, 1998), but most recent large national samples suggest that the prevalence of male homosexuality in modern Western societies, including the United States, is lower than this early estimate (e.g., 1–2% in Billy et al., 1993; 2–3% in Laumann et al., 1994; 6% in Sell et al., 1995; 1–3% in Wellings et al., 1994).\n",
      "963 It is of note, however, that homosexuality is defined in different ways in these studies.\n",
      "964 For example, some use same-sex behavior and not same-sex attraction as the operational definition of homosexuality (e.g., Billy et al., 1993); many sex researchers (e.g., Bailey et al., 2000; Bogaert, 2003; Money, 1988; Zucker and Bradley, 1995) now emphasize attraction over overt behavior in conceptualizing sexual orientation.\"\n",
      "965 (p.33) Also: \"...the prevalence of male homosexuality (in particular, same-sex attraction) varies over time and across societies (and hence is a \"moving target\") in part because of two effects: (1) variations in fertility rate or family size; and (2) the fraternal birth order effect.\n",
      "966 Thus, even if accurately measured in one country at one time, the rate of male homosexuality is subject to change and is not generalizable over time or across societies.\"\n",
